					<p>What is YAML?</p>
					<img src="./images/Yaml_logo.png" alt="Yaml_logo" style="background-color: aliceblue; border-radius: 10px;">
					<p style="text-align: left;">YAML is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly used for
						configuration files and in
						applications where data is being stored or transmitted. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Syntax Example</h3>

					<p>What is CI/CD</p>
					<img src="./images/ci-cd-flow-desktop.png" alt="CI/CD image"
						style="background-color: aliceblue; border-radius: 10px;">
					<p style="text-align: left;">CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing
						automation into the stages of
						continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. Specifically, CI/CD introduces ongoing automation and
						continuous monitoring throughout the lifecycle of apps</p>
				</section>
				<section>Continuous delivery
					<p style="text-align: left;">Continuous delivery automates the release of that validated code to a repository.
						At the end of that process, the operations team is able to deploy an app to production quickly and easily.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>Continuous deployment
					<p style="text-align: left;">Continuous deployment automates releasing an app to production.
						In practice, continuous deployment means that a developerâ€™s change to a cloud application could go live
						within minutes of writing it (assuming it passes automated testing).

					Workflow
				</section>
				<section style="text-align: left;">
					A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs. Workflows are defined by a YAML
					file checked in to your repository and will run when triggered by an event in your repository, or they can be
					triggered manually, or at a defined schedule.
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Workflow basics components:</p>
					<li>One or more events that will trigger the workflow.</li>
					<li>One or more jobs, each of which will execute on a runner machine and run a series of one or more steps.
					</li>
					<li>Each step can either run a script that you define or run an action, which is a reusable extension that can
						simplify your workflow.</li>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Example workflow</p>
					<pre><code data-trim data-noescape style="font-size: 12px; max-height: 500px;">
						name: test-workflow
						on: [workflow_dispatch]
						jobs:
							test:
								runs-on: ubuntu-latest
								steps:
									- name: print Hello GITHUB
									  run: echo Hello GITHUB
					</code></pre>

					Dependencies
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Dependencies</p>
					<p style="text-align: left;">By default, the jobs in your workflow all run in parallel at the same time. If
						you have a job that must
						only run after another job has completed, you can use the needs keyword to create this dependency. If one of
						the jobs fails, all dependent jobs are skipped;</p>
					<pre><code data-trim data-noescape style="font-size: 12px; max-height: 500px;">
							name: test-workflow

					<p>Artifacts</p>
					<p>Artifacts allow you to persist data after a job has completed, and share that data with another job in the
						same workflow. An artifact is a file or collection of files produced during a workflow run. For example, you
						can use artifacts to save your build and test output after a workflow run has ended.</p>
